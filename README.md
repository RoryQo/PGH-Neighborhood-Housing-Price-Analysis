# Pittsburgh Housing Prices Modeling Project

## Overview

This project explores housing prices in Pittsburgh, with a focus on identifying factors that influence property values, such as property characteristics, neighborhood ratings, and sale year. We use a range of statistical techniques, including linear regression, weighted least squares (WLS), ANOVA, and ANCOVA, to understand trends and relationships in housing prices across different neighborhoods.


## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from **Allegheny County**, and we also use additional data from the **Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC)** for real estate sales and property assessments.

### Transaction Data Set (2013 to Present)  

[![View Original Research Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Real%20Estate%20Sales%20Data-0056A0?style=flat&logo=external-link&logoColor=white&color=0056A0)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.3.3.1)  

This dataset provides **transactional data** from 2013 to the present. It includes sales prices, sale dates, and property identification numbers (PINs), but **does not contain property characteristics** (such as house size, condition, etc.).  
**Note**: The primary key is **PARID**, which is equivalent to **PIN** (Property Identification Number).

### Assessor Records (Property Assessments)  



[![View Original Research Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assessor%20Records%20Data-0056A0?style=flat&logo=external-link&logoColor=white&color=0056A0)](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/property-assessments)

This dataset includes **property characteristics** such as square footage, number of rooms, property condition, and assessment values. It provides detailed information about the physical attributes of properties, which is essential for modeling house prices.  
**Note**: The primary key is **PARID**, which corresponds to the **PIN** (Property Identification Number), ensuring that it can be matched with transactional data.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- **Merge**: Merge both data sets together horizontally on the key of zipcodes, then remove identical columns from the merge

- **Pittsburgh Specific**: Since this is county wide data we filtered it to include only data that is within the Pittsburgh city limits (ie. City== Pittsburgh)

- **Missing Values**: Approximately 20% of the 90,000 observations had missing data. After inspection, these missing values were determined to be random, so they were dropped. We retained enough remaining observations for meaningful analysis.

- **Sale Descriptions**: The sale descriptions labeled as "love and affection" were removed because they were associated with very low sale prices that did not reflect accurate market values. Upon inspection, the rate of these sales was stable across ZIP codes, so they were deemed to distort the overall analysis. 

- **Other Sale Descriptions**: Other sale descriptions, such as bank repossessions, could lead to lower sale prices. However, these are not equally distributed across ZIP codes and show an underlying pattern in the data. Since they provide valuable insights into the market, these observations were retained in the dataset.

- **Zipcodes**: Zipcodes needed to have enough observations to get a valid comparison and average price, 4 zipcodes were dropped because they had many less observations than the others (< 220)
  
- **Interaction Grid**: Before building the max model and adjusting means we must check for interaction terms, a grid of scatter plots showing all possible interactions was created. **No interaction terms were significant**, and therefore not included in maximum model.

### Data Transformation

- **Extracting Sale Year**: The sale year was extracted from the `SALEDATE.x` column, which contains the full date. This year is then converted into a factor for use in analysis.

- **Encoding Ratings**: The `GRADEDESC` column, which represents neighborhood ratings, was transformed into an ordered factor. This transformation ensures that the neighborhood ratings are treated as ordinal data in the statistical models. The ratings are ordered from "POOR" to "Highest Cost."

### Cleaned Data Availability

The cleaned data is available for download in this repository. You can find the file under the "data" folder or in the relevant section of this project.

## Statistical Models and Analysis

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The initial steps involve exploring the data with summary statistics and visualizations to identify patterns and understand the structure of the data:
- **Summary Statistics**: Basic descriptive statistics for the dataset are calculated.
- **Price by ZIP Code**: The average housing prices per ZIP code are computed and visualized using a bar chart with error bars indicating the standard error of the mean.

### 2. Linear Regression Models
A series of linear regression models are constructed to predict housing prices based on several independent variables.

#### a. Full Model (Max Model)
The **max model** includes all potential predictors of house price, such as `LOTAREA`, `STYLE`, `YEARBLT`, `GRADEDESC`, `CONDITION`, and more.

```math
\text{PRICE} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{LOTAREA} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{STYLE} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{STORIES} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{YEARBLT} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{EXTERIORFINISH} + \beta_6 \cdot \text{BASEMENT} + \beta_7 \cdot \text{GRADEDESC} + \beta_8 \cdot \text{CONDITION} + \beta_9 \cdot \text{TOTALROOMS} + \beta_{10} \cdot \text{BEDROOMS} + \beta_{11} \cdot \text{FULLBATHS} + \beta_{12} \cdot \text{HALFBATHS} + \beta_{13} \cdot \text{HEATINGCOOLING} + \beta_{14} \cdot \text{FIREPLACES} + \beta_{15} \cdot \text{BSMTGARAGE} + \beta_{16} \cdot \text{FINISHEDLIVINGAREA} + \beta_{17} \cdot \text{SALEYEAR} + \beta_{18} \cdot \text{SALEDESC.x} + \beta_{19} \cdot \text{CONDITION} + \epsilon
```

#### b. Null Model (Min Model)
The **null model** includes only an intercept, essentially predicting the mean price without any independent variables.

```math
\text{PRICE} = \beta_0 + \epsilon
```

#### c. Stepwise Model Selection
The **best model** is selected using a stepwise selection process. This function selects the best predictors based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), which balances model fit and complexity.

### 3. Model Diagnostics

</p>

- **Multicollinearity**: The variance inflation factor (VIF) is calculated to check for multicollinearity among the predictors. A VIF value greater than 10 indicates high collinearity.
- **Influential Points**: Cook's Distance is used to identify and remove highly influential points that might distort the modelâ€™s estimates.
- **Heteroskedasticity**: The Breusch-Pagan test detected heteroskedasticity (non-constant variance of residuals). Robust standard errors are applied to correct for this issue.

#### Identify and remove influential points based on Cookâ€™s Distance

```
influence <- influence.measures(model)
high_influence <- which(influence$infmat[, "cook.d"] > 4/(nrow(df)-length(model$coefficients)-2))
df <- df[-high_influence, ]
```

#### Weighted Least Squares Approach

By applying weights based on the fitted values from an initial model, WLS minimizes the influence of high-variance observations, providing more accurate estimates of the regression coefficients. In **OLS regression**, the ordinary least squares method minimizes the sum of squared residuals under the assumption that the variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables (homoscedasticity). However, when there is **heteroscedasticity** (non-constant variance of residuals), OLS estimates become inefficient, and the standard errors of the coefficients may be biased. 

To address this, **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)** regression applies a **weight** to each observation, which accounts for the varying variability in the data. The weights are typically the **inverse of the variance** of each observation, and they down-weight observations that have larger residuals (i.e., higher variance) and up-weight those with smaller residuals (i.e., lower variance).

The weights are computed as the inverse of the fitted values from an initial **OLS regression** model:

```math
w_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hat{y}_i}}
```

```math
\text{LOG\_PRICE} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{GRADEDESC} + \beta_2 \times \log(\text{FINISHEDLIVINGAREA} + 0.01) + \beta_3 \times \text{SALEDESC.x} + 
\beta_4 \times \text{HEATINGCOOLING} + \beta_5 \times \text{STYLE} + \beta_6 \times \text{FULLBATHS} + \beta_7 \times \log(\text{LOTAREA} + 0.01) + 
\beta_8 \times \text{HALFBATHS} + \beta_9 \times \text{CONDITION} + \beta_{10} \times \text{FIREPLACES} + \beta_{11} \times \log(\text{TOTALROOMS} + 0.01) + 
\beta_{12} \times \text{EXTERIORFINISH} + \beta_{13} \times (\text{SALEYEAR} - \text{YEARBLT}) + \beta_{14} \times \text{BEDROOMS} + \beta_{15} \times \text{STORIES} + \epsilon
```

### 5. Box-Cox Transformation
The **Box-Cox transformation** is applied to the dependent variable (`PRICE`) to identify an optimal transformation (lambda) that improves the modelâ€™s normality.

### 6. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
ANCOVA is performed to compare the mean prices of homes across different ZIP codes, adjusting for other variables in the model. On both the transformed model and the wls model, since they are both incorrect, but are incorrect in opposite ways.  Taking them together can give us a more complete picture.

#### ANOVA Table

| Variable                           | Df   | Sum Sq | Mean Sq | F value   | Pr(>F)    |
|------------------------------------|------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| as.factor(PROPERTYZIP.x)           | 37   | 12011  | 325     | 246.582   | < 2e-16   |
| as.factor(SALEYEAR)                | 13   | 7691   | 592     | 449.356   | < 2e-16   |
| ...                                | ..   | ....   | ...     | .......   | .......   |
| Residuals                          | 140620 | 185128 | 1       |           |           |




### 7. Adjusted Means
Finally, **adjusted means** for the housing prices across ZIP codes are calculated, accounting for nuisance variables like `GRADEDESC`, `SALEDESC.x`, and `HEATINGCOOLING`. These adjusted means are visualized to identify which ZIP codes are the most and least expensive.

## Appendix: Simple Alternative Analysis Approach

In this alternative analysis, we aim to isolate the **underlying value of the location** by subtracting the **fair market value** of the house's physical structure (which includes the appraised value of the building and the lot) from the actual house price. This analysis is based on the assumption that the price of a house can be decomposed into two main components:

- **Fair Market Value (FMV)**: The FMV is assumed to reflect the appraised value of both the land and the building itself. For this analysis, we subtract this value from the house price to estimate the **pure location value**.
- **Location Value**: This value represents the premium placed on a property's location â€” factors such as proximity to schools, amenities, transportation, and other location-based advantages or disadvantages are not reflected by the FMV.
### Process Overview:

1. **Subtract Fair Market Value**: We subtract the **fair market value (FMV)** of the house (which is the combined appraised value of the building and the land) from the **price of the house**. This leaves us with the **location value**, which captures how much the area or neighborhood contributes to the house price, independent of its physical structure.

```math
    \text{Location\_Value} = \text{Price} - \text{Fair Market Value}
```

2. **Group Differences by ZIP Code**: After calculating the location value for each house, we group the **location value differences** by **ZIP code** to identify whether different areas command different underlying values that are not captured by the physical structure of the house itself.

3. **Analysis Objective**: By comparing the location value across different ZIP codes, we can explore whether certain regions have significantly higher or lower underlying values, independent of the size or condition of the houses themselves. This allows us to assess how much value the **neighborhood or location** adds to the overall house price.


### Interpretation of Results:

</p>


Without controlling for the types of houses and other factors, we can see that over time the difference fluctuates much more than in our main analysis. This suggests that, when ignoring the influence of other variables such as house size, condition, and location, the differences in house prices across time appear more volatile. However, without accounting for these other factors, the **confidence intervals of differences between ZIP codes** become much smaller. This indicates that while the raw differences may appear larger, this indicates that the types of houses are similar within zip codes, but can vary widely between zip codes. This is why other confounding factors are important. When controlling for these factors, the differences between ZIP codes become less pronounced but more reliable.
